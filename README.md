# mydotfiles

It's just plain old config files for some tools I use.

They're managed locally with https://github.com/jbernard/dotfiles

Install with `dotfiles --force --sync -R mydotfiles`
Setup VundleVim: `git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim`
Then in Vim : `:PluginInstall`
